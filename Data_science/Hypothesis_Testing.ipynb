    "# Hypothesis Testing.\n",
    "- It is a part of statistics analysis, where ew test the assumotion mode regarding a population parameter. It is generally used when we were to compare a single group with an external standerd and two ai more gruops wuth each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Null Hypothesis : Null hypothesis is a statistical theory that suggest there is no statistical significance between the population . It is denoted by H0 and read as H-naught.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     - Alternative Hypothesis : An alternative hypothesis suggest there is a significant difference between the population parameter. It could be greater or smaller. Basically, it is the contrast of the null hypothesis.it is denoted by H1 or Ha .\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps of Hypothesis Testing.\n",
    "- State null(H0) and alternative(H1) hypothesis:- H0 must always cantain equality( = ). H1 always cantain difference ( >, <, ≠ ). \n",
    "\n",
    "- choose level of significance(alpha):- It is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. It is denoted by (𝛼) and is generally set to 0.05%.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find test statistic.\n",
    "     - Z-Test: It will work when  we find the mean or standard deviation of the population data. It is used when the sample size is greater then 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "     - T-Test: It will work when we find the mean of the population data or standerd deviation of the sample data. It is used when the samlpe size  is less the 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Chi_square Test: It is used when we want ot find the relationahip between two categorical variables.\n",

    "- Find critical values:-  Z-value , T-value, Chi_square value, ect\n",
