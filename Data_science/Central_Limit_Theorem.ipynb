    "# Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "- The central limit theorem states that when plotting the sample will be equal to the population mean and the sample distribution will approach a normal distribution with variance equal to standard error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### There are a few assumption behind the CLT:\n",
    "- the sample data must be sampled and selected randomly from the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There should not be any multicollinearity in the sampled data which is one sample shoud not influance the other sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sample size should be no more than 10% of the population. Generally sample size greater than 30(n>30) is considered to be a good sample size."
